# Characteristics in WW1
* Technology was so unbalanced that there were horses charging against tanks

* No restrooms or showers 
 *So very unhygienic

* lots of trenches
 * The US was producing a tank every 5 minutes

## US preps for war 
They have to prepare the army supplies and morale of that nation.

Germany had 4.5 million compared to US 200,000 
By the end of the war Germany had close to 11 million deployed.



* 10 million volunteered beginning of the war 20 million by the end
* 5 million drafted

* "You don’t just prepare an army for war you have to prepare a nation"

women at home join the workforce in order to fill the places of men who were deployed.


### Dissent is disaproval
#### They were trying to control all of this by limiting "free speech"


## Propaganda 
### Is something that tries to make you believe an idea someone else is pushing

people at home would use propaganda to unite the nation against a common goal
often times this goal would be war against another country

* Better work conditions in order to no longer go on strike


#### Red Scare- The fear of communism

people are scared that communism will

## Disease

Spanish flu kills more than war does and it affects the homelife too
⅕ of the population caught this virus
